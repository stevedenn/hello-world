# hello-world
My first respository

Howdy everyone! My name is Steve, I work for a start-up tech company in Calgary Alberta, but am newbie to coding and APIs.  I've worked with developers for a number of years, but this course should help kick-start my direct experience with these topics.  I'm excited about learning from the course advisors and course participants.

Cheers!
Steve
